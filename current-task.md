# Current Task

## Task: Create Basic Isometric Railway Map

### Objectives:
1. Create an isometric grid-based map system
2. Render basic terrain tiles (grass, water, mountains, desert)
3. Implement pan and zoom controls for map navigation
4. Display a 50x50 tile map as initial world size

### Requirements:
- Use HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Isometric tile view (2:1 ratio diamonds)
- Mouse controls for panning (click and drag)
- Mouse wheel for zooming
- Tile size: 64x32 pixels base size
- Color-coded terrain types:
  - Grass: Green (#4CAF50)
  - Water: Blue (#2196F3)
  - Mountains: Gray (#757575)
  - Desert: Sandy (#FDD835)

### Success Criteria:
- Map renders correctly in isometric view
- User can pan around the map smoothly
- User can zoom in/out with mouse wheel
- Different terrain types are clearly visible
- Performance is smooth (60 FPS target)
